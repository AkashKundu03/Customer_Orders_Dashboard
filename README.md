# Customer_Orders_Dashboard
Data Analysis using MS Excel. I've built a dasboard taking information from Order info table and Customer info table and made an amazing interactive dashboard where you can see all the order informations regarding each customer. During the project I've used lots of advanced excel features like Vlookup, pivot table and also done coding in VBA and I've also used the concept of recording micros and use the logic in VBA.
Some of my project's screenshots is given below:
